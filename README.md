# OpenPerf
Benchmark suit for large scale socio-technical datasets in open collaboration

该项目受如下三个工作的启发：

1、DataPerf：https://dataperf.org/

A new benchmark suite for machine learning datasets and data-centric algorithms proposed by researchers from Coactive.AI, ETH Zurich, Google, Harvard University, Landing.AI, Meta, Stanford University, and TU Eindhoven. DataPerf is a suite of benchmarks that evaluate the quality of training and test data, and the algorithms for constructing or optimizing such datasets, such as core set selection or labeling error debugging, across a range of common ML tasks such as image classification. We plan to leverage the DataPerf benchmarks through challenges and leaderboards.

2、Open Graph Benchmark：https://ogb.stanford.edu/

The Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) is a collection of realistic, large-scale, and diverse benchmark datasets for machine learning on graphs. In addition, the research team also proposed OGB Large-Scale Challenge (OGB-LSC), a collection of three real-world datasets for facilitating the advancements in large-scale graph ML.
