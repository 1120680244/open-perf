# OpenPerf
Benchmark suit for large scale socio-technical datasets in open collaboration

该项目受如下三个工作的启发：

1、ImageNet：https://image-net.org/

The ImageNet project is a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research. More than 14 million images have been hand-annotated by the project to indicate what objects are pictured and in at least one million of the images, bounding boxes are also provided. Since 2010, the ImageNet project runs an annual software contest, the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), where software programs compete to correctly classify and detect objects and scenes.

1、DataPerf：https://dataperf.org/

A new benchmark suite for machine learning datasets and data-centric algorithms proposed by researchers from Coactive.AI, ETH Zurich, Google, Harvard University, Landing.AI, Meta, Stanford University, and TU Eindhoven. DataPerf is a suite of benchmarks that evaluate the quality of training and test data, and the algorithms for constructing or optimizing such datasets, such as core set selection or labeling error debugging, across a range of common ML tasks such as image classification. We plan to leverage the DataPerf benchmarks through challenges and leaderboards.

2、Open Graph Benchmark：https://ogb.stanford.edu/

The Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) is a collection of realistic, large-scale, and diverse benchmark datasets for machine learning on graphs. In addition, the research team also proposed OGB Large-Scale Challenge (OGB-LSC), a collection of three real-world datasets for facilitating the advancements in large-scale graph ML.

主要目标：
- 构建一系列的数据集，特别是基于图的数据集，用于各类数据科学分析方法的评测
- 构建数据集上的不同挑战与任务，大部分来自真实的开源治理与社区运营的场景
- 构建不同任务上的评价指标，用于科学的性能评测，并能够指导现实问题
